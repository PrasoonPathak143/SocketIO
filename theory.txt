Real time connections

websockets -> protocol -> gives full duplex communication -> real time connection open between two person

once request is sent and response is received the connection breaks after receiving the response 
-> that is why http and https are stateless

websocket -> protocol || socket.io -> library -> uses websocket

** Take socket io cdn form net and use on client (frontend here) side **
